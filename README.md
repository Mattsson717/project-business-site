# Business Site

This weeks assignment was to use the techniques we learnt last week and to create an accordion using javascript.

## The problem

I had problems understanding how the javascript worked, but after rewatching the material we was handed and the livesessions for the week and some help from the codecoaches and my team. I managed to get it to work.
I planned to start with the html then the css and lastly the javascript. But I got stuck with the css and I think I
wanted to do too much that I dont have the full knowledge for yet. If I had more time I would try more javascript, I wanted to create a button that changed the themecolors on the page, but I dont feel I have the time to figure it out this week.
